# AI-Based Crypto Trading Signal System

This project provides an AI-driven framework to generate buy/sell signals for cryptocurrency markets. It includes multiple machine learning and deep learning models combined with technical indicators to enhance prediction accuracy and strategy robustness.

## 🔍 Overview

The system uses historical cryptocurrency price data enriched with technical indicators (like RSI, MACD, EMA, etc.) and feeds it into various AI models (e.g., LSTM, DNN, Random Forest, etc.) to predict short-term trends and generate trading signals.

## 🚀 Features

- 📈 Multiple AI models (LSTM, DNN, Random Forest, and more)
- 📊 Technical indicator support (RSI, MACD, EMA, etc.)
- 🧠 Model training and evaluation on historical data
- 📉 Backtesting for signal performance
- 🛠 Modular structure for easy model switching and testing
- 🧪 Experimental model ensemble support (optional)
